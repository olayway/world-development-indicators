Nondiscrimination clause mentions gender in the constitution is whether there is a nondiscrimination clause in the constitution which mentions gender. For the answer to be “Yes,” the constitution must use either the word discrimination or the word nondiscrimination or even when there is a “clawback” provision granting exceptions to the nondiscrimination clause for certain areas of the law, such as inheritance, family and customary law. The answer is “No” if there is no nondiscrimination provision, or the nondiscrimination language is present in the preamble but not in an article of the constitution, or there is a provision that merely stipulates that the sexes are equal, or the sexes have equal rights and obligations. The answer is "N/A" if there is no nondiscrimination provision.
